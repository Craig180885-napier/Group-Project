# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As software warriors we pledge to code the backend out of this, pun intended.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being nice to each other
* Being respectful even when the other person is wrong
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the highest possible grade
* Showing empathy towards the homies
* Havin crackin patter

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Being nasty
* Bringing up politics
* Propagating bad patter

## Our Responsibilities

Everyone is expected to contribute to ticket writing, refinement, planning,
implementation, code reviews, sprint reviews and retrospectives. If someone 
is not pulling their weight then it's the responsibility of the scrum master
to ensure there are sufficient tasks for everyone.

Meeting ettiquette: cameras on, be clothed.

## Contributing to this repo

The onus is on the developer to explain their pull requests. If you are
working from a ticket then the ticket should be linked in the pull request.
A pull request should have been reviewed by two members of the repo before
it is merged.

## Scope

group project.
